## Project Description
DumblyAI is a web-based chatbot that gives interntional dumb answers using state-of-the-art AI models and reverse-engineered prompt logic.
Designed to make users feel smarter, it delivers hilariously incorrect replies in a professional, chatbot-style interface â€” like ChatGPT, but proudly dumb.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In the age of advanced AI, people have stopped feeling smart.
Every question we ask is answered instantly â€” and perfectly â€” by machines. Thereâ€™s no hesitation. No "I think." No "maybe." Just cold, hard, correct answers.

The result?
Humans feel stupid. Powerless. Replaced.
We canâ€™t flex our general knowledge anymore because ChatGPT and Gemini already know it all â€” and better.

Weâ€™re not just losing trivia nightsâ€¦
Weâ€™re losing our confidence.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing **DumblyAI** â€” the worldâ€™s first intellectually humbling AI.
It doesn't just make mistakes â€” it makes them boldly.

Powered by cutting-edge models and expertly degraded using precision prompt-engineering, DumblyAI delivers answers that are spectacularly wrong, yet beautifully confident.

Now, for once, you know more than the bot.
You are the genius.
You are right.
Let DumblyAI be wrong â€” so you donâ€™t have to be.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used  

- **Languages used:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks used:** FastAPI, React  
- **Libraries used:**  
  - `google-generativeai` (Gemini API)  
  - `uvicorn`  
  - `fastapi`  
  - `dotenv`  
  - Tailwind CSS  
- **Tools used:**  
  - Render (Backend Hosting)  
  - React  
  - GitHub  


### Implementation

#### ðŸ§  Backend (FastAPI)
- Exposes a single POST endpoint `/respond` using FastAPI.
- Uses Gemini Pro via `google-generativeai` to generate confidently wrong responses.
- Hosted on Render at: `https://dumblyai.onrender.com/respond`.

#### ðŸ’¬ Frontend (React)
- Built using Bolt.new with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Minimal, dark-mode chat interface similar to ChatGPT.
- Sends user input to the backend and displays replies in a scrollable chat layout.
